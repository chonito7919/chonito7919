# 👋 Hey there! I'm chonito7919

## ⚡ About Me
- 🦸‍♂️ **Entrepreneur** by trade, **Master Electrician** by skill, and an **aspiring open source software developer** by passion (and occasional frustration).
- 💡 I believe in building things—sometimes with code, sometimes with copper wire, always with a bit of sarcasm.
- 🚲 Currently training to bikepack next year. If you see a guy tangled in his bike and laptop cables, that’s probably me.

## 🚀 Featured Project
- [getRich](https://github.com/chonito7919/getRich) (name subject to change, like my mind on Mondays)

## 🛠️ Skills & Tech
- Electrical wizardry (actual sparks may occur)
- Open source tinkering
- Learning to code in public, mistakes included—free entertainment!

## 😜 Fun Facts
- If you ever need to wire up a house or refactor your README, I’m your guy.
- I take my coffee black and my code reviews even blacker.
